# Accessibility-Search-Engine-Optimization
Optimizing a webpage, adding accessibility features to assist with clients that may have disabilities, and/or search engine efficiency.

As this webpage was already complete and functional, my job was to simply clean up the code within, and to follow semantic HTML & CSS guidelines while doing so. Within the debugging/consolidation/organization period, I was able to do the following: I was able to remove all non-semantic div elements, edit and replace class/id names for better optimization, add comments in both CSS & HTML for smoother workflow, consolidate CSS selectors, add alt attributes to each image for improved search engine optimization/text-to-speech interactions, and much more, which can be easily followed through my comments within the code.
